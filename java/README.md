# Building Java

A few ways of creating a runnable jar. From the crazy Makefile method to a couple of correct ways

1. HelloRun - probably incorrect Makefile method. Works but not sure all dependencies are correct
2. hello-mvn - Maven
3. hello-gradle - gradle, using the Maven conversion via gradle init --type pom
